# react-skeleton
Simple boilerplate for React apps based on create-react-app include **scss modules**

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
